## About the Video Course
Python is a versatile programming language. Many industries are now using Python for high-performance computing projects.

This course will teach you how to use Python on parallel architectures. You'll learn to use the power of NumPy, SciPy, and Cython to speed up computation. Then you will get to grips with optimizing critical parts of the kernel using various tools. You will also learn how to optimize your programmer using Numba. You'll learn how to perform large-scale computations using Dask and implement distributed applications in Python; finally, you'll construct robust and responsive apps using Reactive programming.

By the end, you will have gained a solid knowledge of the most common tools to get you started on HPC with Python.
